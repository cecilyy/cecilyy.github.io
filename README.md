<h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>Hi! I am the creator of The Vestra House and I am glad to see you here!<br></p>
  <p><pre>  This is a component of my digital portfolio as I begin to form this digital zine.<br>    I </pre>have always been interested in fashion from a young age. I first got into this creative outlet when my grandma sat me next to her as she sewed dresses for me. Amazed by the process of creating a wearable piece that had started as a two-dimensional piece of cloth, I began to make my own designs.</p>
  <br><p>Here, you will see a collection of my creative past, present, and hopefully future. So enjoy!</p>
